# STM32 OS

A small bare-metal operating system for the STM32F103 Cortex-M3.

The project is built from scratch to study low-level ARM programming,
microcontroller architecture, exceptions, interrupts, scheduling, drivers,
and operating-system fundamentals.

The low-level kernel intentionally does not use STM32 HAL, Arduino, or FreeRTOS.

## Target

- MCU family: STM32F103 medium-density
- CPU: ARM Cortex-M3
- Architecture: ARMv7-M / Thumb-2
- Flash target: 64 KiB
- SRAM target: 20 KiB
- Debug/program interface: SWD
- Programmer/debugger: ST-LINK V2

## Current status

- [x] ARM GNU bare-metal toolchain
- [x] Custom linker script

- [x] SysTick
- [x] Fault diagnostics
- [x] USART1/PA9 polling TX diagnostic console
- [x] Stable 1 ms kernel time API with wraparound-safe comparisons
- [x] USART1 RX / bidirectional command console
- [x] `uptime` kernel introspection command
- [ ] Native USB Device / CDC console
- [ ] I2C driver
- [ ] SSD1306 kernel console
- [ ] Task scheduler
- [ ] PendSV context switching

## Design principles

- Bare metal first.
- Keep the boot path explicit.
- Prefer direct memory-mapped register access while learning the hardware.
- Add abstractions only after the underlying mechanism is understood.
- Measure before optimizing.
- Keep platform-specific code isolated from kernel policy.
- Do not introduce networking into the kernel until the local kernel baseline is stable.

## Current development loop

The project now has an automated hardware validation loop:

source -> build -> ELF/bin validation -> ST-LINK flash -> verify -> reset -> UART capture -> PASS/FAIL -> evidence log

Current UART is TX-only from STM32 to host. A later RX/command-console slice will extend this to a fully bidirectional automated test loop.

Native USB is planned to eventually consolidate normal console/control/update traffic onto the board's micro-USB connector.
