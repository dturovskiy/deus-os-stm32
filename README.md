<!-- END STM32_OS_ACCEPTED_STATE_2026_09_14 -->

A small bare-metal operating system for the STM32F103 Cortex-M3.

The project is built from scratch to study low-level ARM programming,
microcontroller architecture, exceptions, interrupts, scheduling, drivers,
and operating-system fundamentals.

The low-level kernel intentionally does not use STM32 HAL, Arduino, or FreeRTOS.

## Target

- MCU family: STM32F103 medium-density
- CPU: ARM Cortex-M3
- Architecture: ARMv7-M / Thumb-2
- Flash target: 64 KiB
- SRAM target: 20 KiB
- Debug/program interface: SWD
- Programmer/debugger: ST-LINK V2

- [x] Native 128x32 SSD1306 runtime UI with frozen status bar + retained 21x3 console

## Design principles

- Bare metal first.
- Keep the boot path explicit.
- Prefer direct memory-mapped register access while learning the hardware.
- Add abstractions only after the underlying mechanism is understood.
- Measure before optimizing.
- Keep platform-specific code isolated from kernel policy.
- Do not introduce networking into the kernel until the local kernel baseline is stable.

<!-- BEGIN STM32_OS_DEV_LOOP -->
## Current development loop

The project now has an automated hardware validation loop:

source -> build -> ELF/bin validation -> ST-LINK flash -> verify -> reset -> UART capture -> PASS/FAIL -> evidence log

Current USART1 is bidirectional at 115200 8N1 and is part of the automated hardware acceptance loop.

Native USB is planned to eventually consolidate normal console/control/update traffic onto the board's micro-USB connector. The provisional Windows/Linux host application name is **Deus OS CP** (`Deus OS Control Panel`); naming may be revised later.

<!-- BEGIN STM32_OS_SCHED_WAIT_WAKE_ACCEPTED_20260913 -->
## Production scheduler steady-state wait/wake foundation — accepted 2026-09-13

The production scheduler now has an accepted steady-state wait/wake foundation while normal boot remains MSP-owned.

Accepted behavior:

- explicit `SCHEDULER_TASK_BLOCKED` state alongside UNUSED / READY / DONE;
- task-side event wait through `scheduler_wait_events()` / SVC #3;
- ISR-safe `scheduler_event_signal()` wake path;
- pending-event handling closes the wait-vs-signal race;
- no-runnable scheduler state parks the preserved host MSP with `WFE` rather than busy-spinning or falsely completing the run;
- UART RX IRQ publishes an event only after the RX byte is committed to the ring;
- event consumers treat an event as a notification to re-check the FIFO/condition, not as the payload itself;
- normal reset still runs the product console on MSP and does not automatically start the production scheduler.

Accepted firmware:

- candidate: `build\scheduler_wait_wake_foundation_v2\os.bin`
- size: **19932 bytes**
- SHA-256: `C21915F3DFA898C8E9F2FC601BC9E0FDA4ABE8EBB23528BF14F25D82FE28CE81`
- hardware wait/wake rounds: **4/4 PASS**
- legacy scheduler regression: **6/6 PASS before and after**
- lifecycle diagnostic isolation: **7/7 blocked while active**
- UART RX: zero drops / zero errors
- task and MSP canaries: intact
- frozen OLED runtime regression: PASS
- physical OLED appearance: **operator-confirmed PASS**

Harness/evidence/recovery procedures are documented in `docs/HARNESS_EVIDENCE_RECOVERY_PLAYBOOK.md`.

Next implementation boundary: **normal-boot production task ownership / migration**. The canonical design is in `docs/NORMAL_BOOT_PRODUCTION_TASK_OWNERSHIP_PLAN.md` and its hardware/gate contract is in `docs/NORMAL_BOOT_PRODUCTION_TASK_OWNERSHIP_ACCEPTANCE_PLAN.md`. `sleep()` / timer blocking and scheduler priorities remain separate later gates.
