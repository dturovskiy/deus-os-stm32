<!-- BEGIN STM32_OS_USB_STRATEGY -->
## Native USB strategy

The Blue Pill micro-USB connector is a planned first-class OS transport, not only a power connector.

Target progression:

1. Minimal STM32F103 USB Device core on PA11/PA12, implemented without HAL.
2. USB CDC ACM diagnostic/command console.
3. Bidirectional kernel shell/RPC transport over USB.
4. Binary transport for structured telemetry, files, bitmap/framebuffer chunks, and host-rendered UI primitives.
5. Host-side client capable of presenting an interactive remote UI / desktop-like view of the STM32 OS.
6. USB firmware-update path and a small recoverable bootloader so normal development can eventually use the native micro-USB cable without the external UART adapter.
7. Keep UART as the low-level emergency console and ST-LINK as recovery/GDB access even after USB becomes the primary transport.

Constraint: STM32F103C8 is a USB Device target here, not a general USB Host platform. Keyboard/mouse emulation is possible as USB HID device behavior; directly hosting commodity USB peripherals is outside the baseline architecture.
