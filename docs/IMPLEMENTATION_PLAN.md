# STM32 OS — Implementation Plan

<!-- BEGIN STM32_OS_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKPOINT_2026_09_12 -->
## Accepted implementation checkpoint — 2026-09-12

The runtime baseline now includes a hardware-accepted native 128x32 OLED UI lifecycle and the first scheduler foundation slice.

### Scheduler state

Accepted Slice 9A provides:

- a static two-entry TCB pool
- two 512-byte aligned static task stacks
- saved-SP / stack-range / state metadata
- synthetic Cortex-M initial frames compatible with later exception-style restore
- xPSR Thumb-state initialization
- deterministic `scheduler_self_test()`
- UART acceptance command `schedtest -> SCHED_FOUNDATION_OK`.

Slice 9A intentionally does not perform a context switch and does not make PSP, SVC, PendSV, or SysTick the scheduler owner.

### Revised scheduler sequence

Stage A1 — **accepted**:

- static TCB data model
- static task stacks
- synthetic initial task frames
- invariants/self-test.

Stage A2 — next:

- cooperative scheduler activation
- run real task entry functions from prepared task contexts
- establish explicit task/PSP ownership rules
- retain deterministic manual/cooperative switching only.

Stage B:

- PendSV context-switch mechanism
- assembly save/restore of callee-saved registers
- prove round-trip context integrity before preemption.

Stage C:

- SysTick-driven preemption
- fixed-priority scheduling
- idle task.

Stage D:

- sleep queues
- timers
- IPC
- synchronization.

### Current accepted image

- candidate binary: `10752 bytes`
- SHA-256: `29CA6F248B94A861497D2A97C723B4E945208FC4002C363956753599AE38BFBC`
- scheduler static stacks: `1024 bytes`
- TCB storage: `40 bytes`
- `_ebss=0x200006F8`
- remaining SRAM headroom: `18696 bytes`.

The frozen OLED geometry is not part of the scheduler work and must remain unchanged.

## Objective

Build a small, understandable, fast bare-metal operating system for STM32F103-class Cortex-M3 hardware while learning ARM/Thumb assembly, exception mechanics, scheduling, memory layout, drivers, and low-level performance.

The project is not trying to reproduce Linux on a microcontroller. It is a compact embedded kernel with explicit control of the hardware.

## Primary target

- MCU family detected: STM32F101/F102/F103 Medium-density
- CPU: ARM Cortex-M3
- ISA: ARMv7-M / Thumb-2
- Flash target: 64 KiB
- SRAM target: 20 KiB
- programmer/debugger: ST-LINK V2
- debug/program transport: SWD
- development host: Windows 10, PowerShell 7
- compiler: Arm GNU Toolchain, `arm-none-eabi`
- programmer: STM32CubeProgrammer CLI

## Architectural principles

1. Bare metal first.
2. No STM32 HAL, Arduino framework, or FreeRTOS in the kernel baseline.
3. Assembly is used where architecture mechanics matter: startup, exception entry/exit, context switching, and measured hot paths.
4. C is used for policy, drivers, data structures, and readable kernel logic unless assembly has a measured benefit.
5. Static allocation is preferred in early kernel phases.
6. Interrupt handlers remain short and deterministic.
7. Hardware drivers do not own scheduler policy.
8. Networking remains outside the core kernel until scheduler, diagnostics, and local drivers are stable.
9. Every optimization requires a baseline measurement.
10. Hardware evidence and source/build evidence are tracked separately.

```

## Boot architecture

The CPU begins from Flash at `0x08000000`.

- vector[0] -> initial MSP
- vector[1] -> Reset_Handler with Thumb bit
- Reset_Handler copies `.data`
- Reset_Handler clears `.bss`
- Reset_Handler calls kernel_main
- kernel_main initializes platform facilities
- later, scheduler becomes the steady-state execution owner

## Memory strategy

Current:

- `.isr_vector`, `.text`, `.rodata` in Flash
- `.data`, `.bss` in SRAM
- initial MSP at top of 20 KiB SRAM

Future:

- explicit kernel stack budget
- explicit task stack regions
- static task-control-block pool
- no general-purpose heap until there is a concrete requirement
- stack guards/watermarks before adding many tasks

## Time model

Target initial timebase:

- SYSCLK/HCLK: 72 MHz
- SysTick: 1 kHz
- `kernel_ticks`: 32-bit monotonic millisecond tick

Later:

- wraparound-safe deadline comparisons
- optional higher-resolution cycle timing for benchmarks
- tickless idle only after scheduler correctness is proven

## Exception model

Required dedicated handlers:

- Reset
- NMI
- HardFault
- MemManage
- BusFault
- UsageFault
- SVCall
- PendSV
- SysTick

Unused handlers may initially terminate in a deterministic default panic loop.

## Scheduler plan

Stage A:
- cooperative tasks
- static TCBs
- PSP-based task stacks

Stage B:
- PendSV context switch
- assembly save/restore of callee-saved registers

Stage C:
- SysTick preemption
- fixed-priority scheduling
- idle task

Stage D:
- sleep queues
- timers
- IPC
- synchronization

## Diagnostics plan

Order:

1. LED/status pin
2. HardFault capture
3. UART text logging
4. SSD1306 local kernel console
5. structured runtime counters

OLED is a status console, not the primary high-volume log transport.

## Networking plan

Future ESP-01/ESP8266 role:

- connected over UART
- ESP side owns Wi-Fi association and TCP/IP-facing complexity
- STM32 owns kernel and device logic
- communication uses a framed, versioned protocol
- web control is implemented above that protocol
- network failures must not destabilize scheduler/interrupt core

## Performance goals

Track at minimum:

- Flash footprint
- static SRAM footprint
- per-task stack/TCB cost
- interrupt latency
- context-switch cycles
- scheduler overhead
- idle behavior
- driver throughput where relevant

"Fast" means measured latency/throughput with deterministic behavior, not simply writing more assembly.

## Development workflow

For each slice:

1. read MASTER_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md
2. read PROJECT_HANDOFF.md
3. define exact source files to change
4. build only
5. inspect symbols/vector/disassembly as relevant
6. produce a log
7. only then flash
8. verify programmer success
9. verify physical behavior
10. update PROJECT_HANDOFF.md after acceptance

## Deferred topics

Do not implement yet:

- dynamic heap allocator
- filesystem
- USB stack
- TCP/IP directly on STM32
- user/kernel privilege separation
- MPU isolation
- firmware update protocol
- multicore support
- graphical game engine

These can be revisited only after the scheduler and diagnostics baseline is stable.
